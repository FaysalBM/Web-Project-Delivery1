# Deliverable 2 - Web Project
## Implementation
- Users are allowed to Log In and Register using forms, which create a User entity on the database.
- Users can create new Company entities and give access to other users into It.
The test we have developed have the purpose of emulating several functions of our application, therefore we have made them end to end.
Those tests create users, projects and entities.
The "Delete" function is also tested there.
